# ðŸ’¸ Economy Bot Commands - README

This document outlines the full set of modular, per-server scoped economy commands for your Discord bot.
Each command is separated into its own file, grouped under `economy`, and supports a unique in-server economy system.

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Summary

- Each command resides in a separate class inheriting from `BaseEconomyModule`
- Database access is injected through `BotDbContext`
- Each command is registered under the command group: `/economy`
- All commands are **guild-scoped**, meaning balances and currencies are isolated per server
