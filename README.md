# ðŸ’¸ Economy Bot Commands - README

This document outlines the full set of modular, per-server scoped economy commands for your Discord bot.
Each command is separated into its own file, grouped under `economy`, and supports a unique in-server economy system.

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Summary

- Each command resides in a separate class inheriting from `BaseEconomyModule`
- Database access is injected through `BotDbContext`
- Each command is registered under the command group: `/economy`
- All commands are **guild-scoped**, meaning balances and currencies are isolated per server

---

## ðŸ“œ Command List

### `/daily`

> Claim your daily reward.

- Tied to the configured daily currency for the server
- Tracks streaks and gives randomized rewards
- Reward amount scales with streak length

---

### `/modifycurrency <@user> <currency> <amount>`

> Admin command to adjust a user's balance

- Positive values add
- Negative values subtract (but cannot drop below zero)
- Balance is updated only for the current server

---

### `/listcurrencies`

> View all currencies created for this server

- Shows currencies in an embed layout
- Only shows currencies tied to the server the command is used in

---

### `/balance <currency>`

> Check your balance for a specific currency

- Only shows your balance for the current server
- Shows a value even if your balance is zero

---

### `/transfercurrency <@user> <currency> <amount>`

> Send currency to another user

- Sender must have enough funds
- Recipient receives a DM notification (if possible)
- Transactions are per-server and cannot be cross-server

---

### `/addcurrencytype <name>`

> Create a new currency for your server

- Currency is only visible and usable in the current server
- Prevents duplicate currency names within the same server

---

### `/setdailycurrency <currency>`

# Welcome Message Formatting Guide

You can customize your **automated** and **manual welcome messages** using special placeholder tokens. These will be replaced with real user info when the message is sent.

---

## âœ¨ Supported Placeholders

| Placeholder       | Replaced With                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `{user}`          | Mention of the user being welcomed (e.g., `@NewUser`) |
| `{username}`      | Username of the user being welcomed                   |
| `{tag}`           | Full Discord tag of the user (e.g., `NewUser#1234`)   |
| `{requester}`     | Mention of the user who ran the `/welcome` command    |
| `{requestername}` | Username of the requester                             |
| `{requestertag}`  | Full Discord tag of the requester                     |

---

## ðŸ”¤ Special Characters

- To insert a **new line**, use `\\n`  
  Example:  
   `Welcome {user}!\nWe're so glad to have you here!`

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Message

Input:
`ðŸ“£ Message from {requester}:\nWelcome {user} to the server!\nPlease check out the #rules channel.`

Output (if requested by `@AdminUser` for `@NewUser`):

```
ðŸ“£ Message from @AdminUser:
Welcome @NewUser to the server!
Please check out the #rules channel.
```

---

## ðŸ›  Best Practices

- Keep the message friendly, short, and clear.
- Use `\\n` to break up longer blocks into paragraphs.
- Use `{user}` and `{requester}` to make the message feel more personal.
- Avoid ping spam or long inline formatting (no Discord markdown like `**bold**` or `__underline__` unless intended).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- If `{requester}` is used in the **automated welcome message**, it will default to `System`.
- If a placeholder is not recognized, it will be left unchanged in the output.
